# Capstone-IBM-Profissional-Certificate

**Overview**<br>
In this capstone course you will apply various Data Science skills and techniques that you have learned as part of the previous courses.
<br>
You will assume the role of a Data Scientist who has recently joined an AI-powered weather data analytic company and be presented with a challenge that requires data collection, analysis, basic hypothesis testing, visualization, modelling, and dashboard to be performed on real-world datasets.
<br>

You will undertake the tasks of:<br>

  - Collecting and understanding data from multiple sources
  - Performing data wrangling and preparation with regular expressions and Tidyverse
  - Performing exploratory data analysis with SQL and visualization using Tidyverse and ggplot2
  - Performing modelling the data with linear regressions using Tidymodels
  - Building an interactive dashboard using R Shiny

The project will culminate with a presentation of your data analysis report, with an executive summary for the various stakeholders in the organization. You will be assessed on both your work for the various stages in the data analysis process, as well as the final deliverable.
<br>
This project is a great opportunity to showcase your Data Science skills, and demonstrate your proficiency to potential employers.
